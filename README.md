Analysis of an Existing Water Table 
This project forms part of a postdoc project understanding water table mapping.
Can we take existing water table maps and: 
firstly check the veracity of this map, and
secondly value add to this map by deriving conceptual information such as hydrogeology, recharge and discharge zones.
